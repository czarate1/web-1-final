      <h5 id="about"> I’m Cindy, a technical writer with a passion for UX design, based in Washington </h5>
      <p> I am working to better understand how technical writing and design can lead to better user interactions and experiences. I love when both worlds come together creating a mix of problem solving and creativity. I also enjoy generating new ideas, working with others, and creating projects that make an impact.
        In my free time you can find me hanging out with my cat, sipping on matcha tea, listening to records, or taking care of my plants!

        If you have a project I can help with, please get in touch!

      <h6> Car Interface Redesign </h6>
      <p> For my UX 1 final I decided to redesign my car’s interface. I choose this product because it’s the only thing I dislike about my car. I created it using figma. At the time, it was my first time creating a project of that size (32 screens). It took me about three weeks. I conducted research by doing a comparative analysis of new car interfaces. I took what I liked the best and incorporated it into the design and functionality of it. </p>

      <h6> Game Instruction App </h6>
      <p> For my UX 2 class I designed an app that holds game instructions. I wanted it to give users the same feeling they get when they walk into Target. It’s not a feeling you can explain, only experience. I designed the homepage of the app to almost mimic the app store. I did this to encourage users to play more games and also find new games they’ve never heard of. It was my first time using it on boarding, as well. The images and candy themed designs are not mine.

      <h6> First Five Years & Beyond Grant Proposal </h6>
      <p> I worked with two other technical writers on the grant proposal. The purpose of the proposal was to get funding for First Five Years & Beyond, a non-profit in Washington, from NW Children's Foundation and bring awareness to education inequalities in Washington State. Writing the proposal involved learning the principles and practices of proposal writing. We focused on repetition, creating a strong and compelling need statement, and finding effective data that supported how funding can close education inequalities. In order to write a gripping proposal we needed to research who we were writing the proposal for. We had to capture NW Children’s Foundation’s vision and shape our writing to ensure we were a perfect match for them. We synthesized the information we had gathered to reflect a cohesive message, written in one voice.

      <h6> EWU Sustainability Site </h6>
      <p>During my junior year at Eastern Washington University our class was asked to write content for the EWU Sustainability site. My topic was environmental justice. Throughout the quarter I met with sustainability, Chicana/o/x, and African studies professors to conduct research on how different communities at Eastern are impacted by environmental injustices. After each interview I simplified the complex information into clear and impactful stories to capture the reader's attention. I narrowed my scope down to three areas; how people of color are disproportionately affected, food insecurity, and inadequate access to clean water and air. </p>
